# Spotify Interview Challenge

## Problem

As part of the spotify sumer intern interview process, I had to write a website
that uses the OMDB API to search for movies and "nominate" them. Nominating a
movie simply adds them to the list of the side of the screen.

## My Solution

I went with a simple, minimalistic design that contains a search bar and two
columns of elements underneath. One column displays movie elements that includes
the movie title, thumbnail, year of release and a button to nominate the movie.
The second column stores the nominated movies.

## Next Steps

At the time I wrote this, I didn't notice a bug where the first search result
does not update when a different search term is requested.
